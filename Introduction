solata Network is excited backing our vision to build the modular data access layer for Web3.
While Celestia and Dymension focus on Data Availability, Settlement and Consensus, rollups will also need an Access layer. This is what solata has built - allowing developers and users to send and retrieve data from any blockchain.
‍Blockchains and infrastructure can be extremely technical. But we've designed solata so that everyday users don't need to run nodes to participate and help scale crypto.
‍Anyone can now earn points by changing your wallet’s blockchain connection to Lava and using your wallet as normal. Access web3 through solata.
